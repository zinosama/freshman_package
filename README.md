# freshman_package
Freshman Package is a beta project that I initiated at the University of Rochester. This project aimed to help freshman international students order daily necessities such as pillow and comforter before they arrive. The website features innovative and economic products from IKEA and leverages volume to arrange efficient freight and distribution. The service also allows consumers to place orders in advance and provides free delivery to campus dorms on scheduled dates.

I designed and implemented the website from scratch over two months during the summer of 2015. I learned AngularJS and Google Firebase, utilized Stripe payment system, purchased SSL certificate, and deployed the website on a shared hosting service. As the second website that I built while learning on my own, Freshman Package does not have the most organized code base. I was also not aware of a lot of the best practice at that time. However, since the website is not longer serving its customers, I decided to preserve the rudimentary code base as an evidence of my later progress instead of refactoring.
